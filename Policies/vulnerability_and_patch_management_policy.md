# VULNERABILITY & PATCH MANAGEMENT POLICY

Version: 1.0  
Approval Date: (insert date)  
Owner: Information Security Officer (ISO)  
Classification: Internal / Restricted  

---

## **1. Purpose**
The purpose of this Vulnerability & Patch Management Policy is to ensure that all information systems are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities, remediated in a timely manner, and maintained with up-to-date patches in accordance with NIST SP 800-40 and NIST SP 800-53 RA, SI, and CM control families.

---

## **2. Scope**
This policy applies to:

- All organizational IT assets (servers, workstations, network devices, applications, cloud instances)  
- All employees, contractors, and third-party managed systems  
- All internal and external vulnerability scanning activities  

---

## **3. Policy Statements**

### **3.1 Vulnerability Scanning**
- Vulnerability scans must be conducted:  
  - **Weekly** for critical systems  
  - **Monthly** for all other systems  
  - **After major changes**  
  - **After security incidents**  
- Authenticated scans must be used when possible.  
- Scan results must be reviewed and documented.

### **3.2 Vulnerability Classification**
Vulnerabilities must be categorized based on severity (e.g., CVSS):

- **Critical (9.0–10.0)**  
- **High (7.0–8.9)**  
- **Medium (4.0–6.9)**  
- **Low (0.1–3.9)**  

### **3.3 Vulnerability Remediation Timeframes**
All findings must be remediated according to the following deadlines:

| Severity   | Time to Remediate |
|------------|-------------------|
| Critical   | **24–72 hours**   |
| High       | **7 days**        |
| Medium     | **30 days**       |
| Low        | **90 days**       |

Extensions require ISO approval.

### **3.4 Patch Management Requirements**
- Patches must be applied based on vendor release cycles.  
- Patch testing must occur before deployment unless emergency patching is required.  
- Unsupported or end-of-life software must not be used in production.

### **3.5 Emergency Patch Handling**
- Emergency patches must be applied immediately when a vulnerability is actively exploited.  
- Emergency changes must be documented within 24 hours and reviewed by the CAB.

### **3.6 Verification & Validation**
- Remediation efforts must be verified through:  
  - Rescans  
  - Change logs  
  - Configuration management tools  
- False positives must be documented.

### **3.7 Third-Party & Cloud Systems**
- Vendors managing systems must adhere to this policy.  
- Cloud-hosted systems must follow CSP (Cloud Service Provider) patch SLAs.  
- Evidence of patching must be retained.

### **3.8 Reporting**
- Monthly vulnerability reports must be submitted to leadership.  
- Critical findings must be escalated immediately to the ISO.

---

## **4. Roles & Responsibilities**

### **Information Security Officer (ISO)**
- Oversees vulnerability management activities  
- Approves remediation exceptions and extensions  

### **System Administrators**
- Apply patches and fixes within required timeframes  
- Document and validate remediation  

### **Security Operations Team (SOC)**
- Conducts vulnerability scans  
- Assesses findings and communicates risks  

### **Third-Party Vendors**
- Must provide evidence of patching  
- Must remediate vulnerabilities according to contract terms  

---

## **5. Compliance**
Failure to follow this policy may result in disciplinary action, contract termination, or regulatory penalties.

---

## **6. Review Cycle**
This policy must be reviewed **annually** or when major technology or threat landscape changes occur.
