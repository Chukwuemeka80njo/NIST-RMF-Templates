# **SECURITY ASSESSMENT & AUTHORIZATION POLICY**

Version: 1.0
Approval Date: (insert date)
Owner: Information Security Officer (ISO)
Classification: Internal / Restricted

---

## **1. Purpose**

The purpose of this Security Assessment & Authorization Policy is to define requirements for evaluating security controls, ensuring systems receive appropriate authorization before operating, and maintaining continuous security assurance throughout each system’s lifecycle.

---

## **2. Scope**

This policy applies to:

* All organizational information systems
* All environments hosting organizational data (on-premises, cloud, hybrid)
* All employees, contractors, and third-party service providers involved in system development, assessment, or authorization
* All components, applications, and services that transmit, store, or process organizational information

---

## **3. Policy Statements**

### **3.1 Security Assessments**

* Independent security assessments must be conducted before any system is authorized to operate.
* Assessments shall evaluate the effectiveness of security controls according to NIST SP 800-53A or approved organizational methodology.
* Automated assessment tools should be used whenever feasible.
* Assessment results must be documented in a Security Assessment Report (SAR).

---

### **3.2 Remediation & Risk Responses**

* Identified vulnerabilities must be analyzed and assigned risk ratings.
* System owners must develop a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) for all unresolved findings.
* High-risk findings must be remediated within required timelines as defined by organizational risk tolerance.

---

### **3.3 Authorization to Operate (ATO)**

* All systems must receive written Authorization to Operate (ATO) from the Authorizing Official (AO) before deployment.
* The ATO decision must consider:

  * Security Assessment Report (SAR) results
  * POA&M status
  * Privacy impacts
  * Residual risk
* ATO decisions may result in:

  * Full Authorization
  * Interim Authorization (IATT)
  * Denial of Authorization

---

### **3.4 Continuous Monitoring**

* Systems must undergo continuous monitoring to ensure ongoing effectiveness of security controls.
* Automated monitoring solutions (SIEM, vulnerability scanners, CSPM tools, etc.) shall be implemented where possible.
* Continuous monitoring results must feed into ongoing POA&M updates.

---

### **3.5 Reauthorization Requirements**

* Systems must be reauthorized at least every **3 years**, or sooner if:

  * Major changes occur
  * Significant security incidents impact the system
  * New risks affect system operations
