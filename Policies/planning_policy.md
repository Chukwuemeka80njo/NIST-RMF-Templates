# **PLANNING POLICY**

Version: 1.0
Approval Date: (insert date)
Owner: Information Security Officer (ISO)
Classification: Internal / Restricted

---

## **1. Purpose**

The purpose of this Planning Policy is to establish requirements for developing, documenting, and maintaining security plans that define how organizational information systems implement and maintain security controls in alignment with the Risk Management Framework (RMF).

---

## **2. Scope**

This policy applies to:

* All organizational information systems
* All personnel involved in system design, development, implementation, and operation
* All environments hosting or processing organizational information (on-premises, cloud, hybrid)
* All system owners, administrators, and security personnel

---

## **3. Policy Statements**

### **3.1 Security Planning Requirements**

* Each information system must have a documented **System Security Plan (SSP)**.
* The SSP must describe system components, operational environment, implemented security controls, and known risks.
* Security plans must be developed before system deployment and updated throughout the system lifecycle.

---

### **3.2 Plan Approval**

* The SSP must be reviewed and approved by:

  * System Owner
  * Information Security Officer (ISO)
  * Authorizing Official (AO)

---

### **3.3 Security Plan Maintenance**

* SSPs must be updated to reflect:

  * System changes (hardware, software, architecture, or data flows)
  * New or modified security controls
  * Results from assessments or monitoring activities
* SSPs must undergo a formal review at least **annually**.

---

### **3.4 System Life-Cycle Planning**

* Security considerations must be integrated into each phase of the system development life cycle (SDLC).
* All technology acquisitions must include security and privacy requirements.
* Major redesigns or migrations require updated planning documentation and new risk assessments.

---

### **3.5 Resource Planning**

* System owners must identify and allocate resources necessary to implement, maintain, and monitor security controls.
* Resource planning must consider:

  * Personnel
  * Training
  * Tools and technologies
  * Budget requirements

---

### **3.6 Security Architecture Documentation**

* System architecture must be documented and maintained, including:

  * Network diagrams
  * Data flow diagrams
  * System boundary definitions
  * Integration with external systems
* Architectural diagrams must be updated as systems evolve.

## **5. Compliance**

Non-compliance with this policy may result in delays in system authorization, suspension of operations, or disciplinary action as determined by organizational leadership.
