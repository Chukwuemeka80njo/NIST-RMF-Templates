# Patch & Vulnerability Management Procedure  
**File:** patch_and_vulnerability_management_procedure.md  
**Category:** Procedures  
**Related Policies:** System Maintenance Policy, Vulnerability Management Policy, Configuration Management Policy, Risk Assessment Policy  
**Mapped NIST Controls:** RA-5, SI-2, SI-3, SI-4, CM-2, CM-3, CM-6, PM-5

## 1. Purpose  
This procedure defines the steps for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, remediating, and verifying vulnerabilities and required patches in organizational systems to reduce security risks and comply with NIST 800-53 requirements.

---

## 2. Scope  
This procedure applies to:  
- All servers, endpoints, applications, network devices, and cloud systems  
- All production, staging, and development environments  
- All employees, contractors, and administrators who manage or maintain systems  
- Third-party managed systems that access organizational data

---

## 3. Definitions  

**Vulnerability:** A weakness in a system that can be exploited.  
**Patch:** A vendor-supplied update that fixes security flaws or improves stability.  
**Zero-Day:** A vulnerability that is actively exploited before a patch exists.  
**Risk Rating:** Severity based on CVSS (Critical, High, Medium, Low).  
**Remediation:** Fixing or mitigating a vulnerability or applying a patch.

---

## 4. Procedure  

### 4.1 Vulnerability Scanning  
1. Conduct automated vulnerability scans on all systems at least **monthly**.  
2. Perform authenticated scans wherever possible.  
3. Perform on-demand scans after major configuration changes.  
4. Generate and securely store scan reports.  

---

### 4.2 Vulnerability Identification & Intake  
Sources may include:  
- Automated scanners  
- Vendor security advisories  
- CISA alerts  
- Zero-day disclosures  
- Penetration tests  
- Security incidents  
- Threat intelligence feeds  

All findings must be logged in the tracking system.

---

### 4.3 Risk Rating & Prioritization  
Each vulnerability must be assigned a severity based on CVSS:

| Severity | Required Action Time |  
|---------|-----------------------|  
| **Critical** (9.0–10.0) | Remediate within **72 hours** |  
| **High** (7.0–8.9) | Remediate within **10 days** |  
| **Medium** (4.0–6.9) | Remediate within **30 days** |  
| **Low** (0.1–3.9) | Remediate within **90 days** |  

**Zero-Day vulnerabilities** must be reviewed **immediately** by Security for emergency action.

---

### 4.4 Patch Testing  
Before deployment, patches must be tested in a staging environment to confirm:  
- No operational impact  
- No compatibility issues  
- No unexpected behavior  
- Logging and monitoring remain intact  

Testing results must be documented.

---

### 4.5 Patch Deployment  
1. Apply patches during approved change windows.  
2. Follow the configuration management & change control procedure.  
3. Deploy patches using automated patch management tools whenever possible.  
4. For high-impact updates, notify affected users in advance.  

---

### 4.6 Emergency Patching  
Emergency patches may bypass standard change windows if:  
- A zero-day exploit exists  
- A system is actively compromised  
- A critical security exposure is identified  

Emergency changes must be documented and reviewed post-implementation.

---

### 4.7 Verification  
After patching:  
- Re-scan affected systems  
- Confirm vulnerability is remediated  
- Validate system stability  
- Document verification results  

---

### 4.8 Exceptions  
Exceptions may be granted only when:  
- Patching introduces system instability  
- Vendor patches are unavailable  
- System is being decommissioned  

All exceptions must include:  
- Business justification  
- Risk acceptance form  
- Compensating security controls  
- Approval from the ISO

---

### 4.9 Reporting & Metrics  
Security must generate monthly reports that track:  
- Outstanding vulnerabilities  
- SLA compliance rates  
- Remediation timelines  
- Trends and recurring issues  

Reports are submitted to leadership.

---

## 5. Responsibilities  

### Security Team  
- Lead vulnerability scanning  
- Assign risk ratings  
- Validate remediation  
- Produce monthly reports  

### System Administrators  
- Review scan findings  
- Apply patches  
- Test and verify updates  

### Information Security Officer (ISO)  
- Approve exceptions  
- Oversee compliance  
- Escalate high-risk vulnerabilities  

---

## 6. Enforcement  
Failure to follow this procedure may result in disciplinary action, loss of system access, or compliance violations.

---

## 7. Review  
This procedure must be reviewed **annually** or when significant changes to systems occur.
